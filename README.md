NUS-Module-Planner
==================

A tool for all NUS students to record all the modules they have taken so far and plan what they wish to take in future semesters, and generate essential information for their reference.


These are the fields inside the file that are for you to fill up:

<b>Module Code<br>
Type<br>
Level xxxx MC<br>
Semester<br>
Grade<br>
S/U</b>


The table on the right is generated based on all the above data you have placed. 

Have fun!



Module Code
===========
Enter the module code (Or name, up to you) in the field. Keep it short and sweet so its easy to view the statistics.
Use this to plan all the modules you wish to take.

Type
====
Put which category the module falls under (Core, GEM, SS, etc). The naming convention is up to you. 
You create whatever categories you want, the file will generate a new table from that new category you gave.
Try to limit the total number of unique categories to a maximum of 12, as there's a limit of 12 tables the file can generate.

Level xxxx MC
=============
Provide the number of MCs this module has, under the right level. 

Semester
========
Write the semester that you will be taking or have taken the module. 

Grade
=====
Pretty intuitive, enter the grade you got. If it's pass/fail, enter P or F respectively. 
If you have not gotten a grade for the module, leave it blank

S/U
===
Indicate Y if you want to S/U the module, and N if you don't want to.
